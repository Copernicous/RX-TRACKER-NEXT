    items:[
      { q:'What are the four stat cards at the top?',
        a:'<b>Active Patients</b> — patients currently marked as active. <b>Pending RX</b> — prescription records with at least one workflow step still unchecked. <b>Total RX</b> — every RX record ever created in the date window. <b>Total Patients</b> — all patients including inactive ones. Clicking the number on any card opens a filtered pop-up showing exactly those records. The counts respect whatever date range you have selected.' },
      { q:'What counts as a "Pending" RX?',
        a:'The Dashboard Pending card counts every RX with one or more active workflow steps incomplete, including expired cycles. Clicking it opens RX Records with All Incomplete selected. The regular Pending status remains an operational view that excludes the separately labeled Expired status.' },
      { q:'RX Pipeline chart — reading the bars',
        a:'The four summary cards are mutually exclusive Workflow Status groups: Not Started, In Progress, Expired, and Completed. Each horizontal bar below shows the RX record\'s actual Current Stage (the highest active workflow step completed). Expired RX remain included in their actual Current Stage, so the stage bars continue to match the Current Stage filters.' },
      { q:'Date range filter — how to use it',
        a:'The <b>From</b> and <b>To</b> date fields at the top of the dashboard filter every stat and chart on the page. Leave both blank to see all-time data. Click <b>"Today"</b> to reset to just today. You can also type dates manually in YYYY-MM-DD format. The filter does NOT affect the Patients table — it only filters RX-based statistics.' },
      { q:'Active Patients vs Total Patients — the difference',
        a:'<b>Active Patients</b> is the count of patients whose record has "Active Patient" checked. <b>Total Patients</b> includes everyone ever added, including inactive patients and soft-deleted patients that have been restored. A patient becomes inactive when a staff member unchecks the "Active Patient" toggle in their edit form.' }

Optional but useful: Patient Code (your internal ID), Address, Service Date, Clinic, Patient Transport Company, and Pharmacy Transport Company. Click <b>Save</b>. Before saving, the system automatically checks for duplicate patients with the same first name, last name, and date of birth — if a duplicate is found, you will get a warning and the save will be blocked.' },

Fields that did not change are shown greyed out for context. This works for patients, RX records, users, settings, API keys, workflow step completions — everything in the system.' },

        a:'Click the <b>clipboard/notes icon</b> on any patient row. A side panel opens showing all existing notes for that patient in chronological order. Type your note in the text box at the bottom and click <b>"Add Note"</b>. Notes are automatically stamped with the author name and exact date/time. Notes are read-only after submission — they cannot be edited. Only administrators can delete notes. This design ensures an accurate, tamper-evident care record.' },
      { q:'Printing a patient record',
        a:'Click the <b>print icon 🖨️</b> on any patient row. A formatted print preview opens in a new modal or window showing the patient demographics, all RX records, and workflow progress in a clean printer-friendly layout. Use your browser\'s print dialog (Ctrl+P) to print or save as PDF.' },
      { q:'Soft delete — what happens when you delete a patient',
        a:'Patients are never permanently erased. Clicking the <b>red delete icon</b> on a patient row marks the patient as deleted and hides them from the main list — but the record still exists in the database. Administrators can restore a soft-deleted patient at any time. All the patient\'s RX records, notes, and audit history are preserved. This protects you from accidental data loss.' },
      { q:'Search and filters on the patient list',
        a:'The search bar at the top of the patient list filters in real time as you type. It matches against patient name, patient code, and phone number simultaneously. The <b>Status dropdown</b> lets you show Active only, Inactive only, or All patients. Click any <b>column header</b> to sort the table by that column (click again to reverse the sort direction). Use the <b>Rows per page</b> selector to control how many patients appear per page.' },

        a:'If a colleague opens the same patient page or patient modal at the same time as you, a <b>yellow warning banner</b> appears at the top of the patient: "👁️ Maria Rodriguez is also viewing this patient." This is a <b>soft warning — it does NOT lock or block editing</b>. Both users can still edit freely. The banner is there to alert you that simultaneous edits might conflict, so you can coordinate. The banner shows the user\'s full name and how long ago they opened the record. It updates every 60 seconds and disappears automatically when they leave.' },
      { q:'Lock TTL — the 5-minute automatic expiry',
        a:'TTL means "Time To Live." When a user opens a patient page, the system records a "viewer lock" with a 5-minute expiry timer. As long as the user stays on the page, the browser sends a silent heartbeat signal every 60 seconds to renew the lock. If they close the tab, lose internet, or go idle for over 5 minutes, the lock expires and is removed automatically. This means the yellow banner disappears even if someone forgot to close a patient tab — you won\'t see a phantom "someone is viewing" warning for hours.' }

If you are trying to mark a step but nothing happens, check that your user role has permission to edit RX records — Viewer role cannot complete steps.' },
      { q:'Undo last workflow step — correcting a mistake',
        a:'Every RX record has an <b>"Undo Last Step"</b> button that becomes active after at least one step has been completed. Clicking it reverses only the most recently completed step — it does not undo all steps. This is designed for simple corrections, like accidentally clicking the wrong step. The undo action is also logged in the Audit Log.' },

You can combine basic and advanced filters together. For example: filter by Clinic = "Memorial" AND Status = "Active" AND Service From = "2025-01-01" to get all active patients at Memorial clinic seen this year.' },
      { q:'RX Action Report tab — what it shows',
        a:'The RX Action Report shows each RX record with its Current Stage, Current Stage Date, full Stage History, Next Action Required, and workflow progress.

      { q:'Printing a report',
        a:'Click the <b>print icon 🖨️</b> on either report tab. The browser print dialog opens. The report is formatted for printing — page headers, borders, and table layout are all optimized for letter or A4 paper. If the table is very wide, use Landscape orientation in your printer settings.' },

        a:'Workflow Actions define the stages a prescription goes through from receipt to delivery. Examples: "Prescription Received", "Insurance Verified", "Medication Packaged", "Out for Delivery", "Delivered", "Patient Signature Obtained". Every RX record gets a copy of all workflow steps and tracks whether each one is complete. This gives you visibility into exactly where every prescription is in the process at any moment.' },

      { q:'Editing or reordering steps',
        a:'In Settings → Workflow Actions, you can edit the name and description of any step. Steps can be reordered by dragging them up or down — the order here determines the order the dots appear on RX records, left to right. Reordering only affects visual presentation, not the ability to complete steps in any order.' },

If you lose it, you have two options: 1) Delete the key and generate a new one, then update your script with the new key. 2) Keep the old key active but useless, and generate a second key for the script. Deleting a key is immediate and permanent — any script using it will start receiving 401 Unauthorized errors immediately.' },
      { q:'Enable and disable keys without deleting',
        a:'Each key row has a toggle switch. Flip it off to disable the key — all requests using that key will immediately get a 401 error. Flip it back on to re-enable it. This is useful if you suspect a key was leaked and want to temporarily block it while you investigate, without permanently revoking it.' },

    intro:'The system is designed for multiple staff members to work simultaneously. Here is exactly how concurrent access is handled and what you can expect.',
    items:[
      { q:'Can two people use the system at the same time?',
        a:'Yes, fully. Multiple users can be logged in and working at the same time with no restrictions. Each user has their own browser session with their own authentication token. The server handles concurrent requests efficiently.' },
      { q:'Can two people edit the same patient at the same time?',
        a:'Yes — the system uses a <b>Soft Lock</b> model rather than a hard block. Both users can open and edit the same patient simultaneously. The system warns you with a yellow banner if another user has the patient open, but it does not prevent you from editing. This avoids the frustrating situation where someone locks a record and then walks away, preventing anyone else from working on it.' },
      { q:'What is the 👁️ yellow viewer banner and what triggers it?',
        a:'When any user opens a patient page (either the timeline page or the edit modal), the system registers them as an active viewer of that patient. Any other user who opens the same patient within the next 5 minutes sees a yellow banner at the top saying: "👁️ [Name] is also viewing this patient — (opened 2 min ago)". If multiple users are viewing, the banner says "[Name1], [Name2] are also viewing" and shows a count badge.' },
      { q:'TTL — the 5-minute lock expiry in detail',
        a:'TTL = Time To Live. Every viewer registration has a 5-minute expiry timer. While the user stays on the patient page, their browser sends a silent HTTP request (called a heartbeat) every 60 seconds to renew the 5-minute timer. The timer resets to 5 minutes each time. If the heartbeat stops — because the tab was closed, the browser crashed, the network went down, or the user navigated to a different page — the timer counts down. After 5 minutes with no heartbeat, the lock is deleted and the viewer banner disappears for anyone else viewing that patient. This is why you will never see a banner saying someone has been "viewing" a patient for 3 hours — the maximum time is 5 minutes past when they actually left.' },
      { q:'What if two users save the same patient at the exact same time?',
        a:'The system uses "last write wins" — the last save overwrites any overlapping fields from the previous save. If User A and User B both open Patient John Smith, User A changes the phone number, User B changes the address, and they both save within seconds of each other — both changes will be recorded because they edited different fields. But if both edited the phone number, only the last save\'s value will be kept. The Audit Log records every save with the exact before/after values, so if there is a conflict you can always see what happened and manually correct it.' },
      { q:'How many users can use the system at once?',
        a:'There is no configured hard limit. The system runs on Node.js with a non-blocking architecture, which means it can handle dozens of concurrent users efficiently on modest server hardware. For a typical clinic with 5-20 simultaneous users on a local network server, performance will be very fast. Performance depends on your server\'s CPU, RAM, and database connection speed, not on any application-level limit.' }

      { q:'How to import patients from a CSV file',
        a:'1) Go to the <b>Import</b> page from the sidebar. 2) Click <b>"Download Template"</b> for the Patients data type. This downloads a CSV with the exact column headers the system expects. 3) Open the CSV in Excel or Google Sheets and fill in your data. Do not rename, reorder, or delete any column headers. 4) Save the file as CSV format. 5) Back on the Import page, click <b>"Choose File"</b> and select your completed CSV. 6) Click <b>"Import"</b>. The system validates every row and shows you a results table with a green check for succeeded rows and a red X for failed rows with the specific reason (e.g., "Missing required field: Last Name" or "Duplicate patient: already exists").' },
      { q:'Required columns and date format',
        a:'Required columns for patient import: <b>firstName</b>, <b>lastName</b>, <b>dob</b> (date of birth), <b>phone</b>. Optional: patientCode, address, serviceDate, clinicName, isActive (true/false). <b>All dates must be in YYYY-MM-DD format</b> — for example 1985-03-15 for March 15, 1985. If you use MM/DD/YYYY format the import will fail on date fields.' },
      { q:'How duplicates are handled during import',
        a:'Before importing each row, the system checks if a patient with the same <b>first name + last name + date of birth</b> already exists. If a match is found, that row is skipped and reported as a warning (not a failure). The existing patient record is NOT modified. This prevents you from accidentally creating duplicate records during a re-import. Rows that are skipped as duplicates are listed in the results so you can review them.' },
      { q:'What happens to failed rows?',
        a:'Failed rows appear in the results table with a red indicator and a specific error message. The most common reasons for failure: a required field is blank, a date is in the wrong format, or a referenced value (like a clinic name) does not exist in the system. You can correct the failed rows in your CSV file and re-upload just those rows — the system will skip duplicates so you will not double-count the rows that already succeeded.' }

Store downloaded backup files in a secure off-site location — a USB drive kept in a different room, a cloud storage service, or a network file share. The on-server copies are protected by your server security, but a separate copy is essential for disaster recovery.' },
      { q:'How long to keep backups',
        a:'Best practice is to keep at minimum the last 7 daily backups and at least one backup per month for the past year. Delete older files from the server to save disk space. Always keep copies off-server. The Backups page shows how much total disk space all backup files are using.' },
      { q:'Restoring from a backup',
        a:'Restoring requires direct access to the server and the database. Contact your system administrator. The backup file is a standard SQL dump that can be restored using standard PostgreSQL tools (pg_restore or psql command). Plan for 5-30 minutes of downtime depending on the database size. Test restoration on a staging environment before you need to do it in an emergency.' }
